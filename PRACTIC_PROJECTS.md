#### Project #1 
Youtube Channel's Videos Data Scraper [2023-03-05]

1. You should write a python program which should be able to scroll a youtube channel webpage all the way to then end. For example, you have this channel of my teacher https://www.youtube.com/@zusmani78/videos. Your code should be able to go to this page and automatically scroll down until you reach the end of the page.
2. Once you have reached the end of the page, you should scrape the information of all the videos present on that page and nicely store that in a CSV file using pandas. The output CSV file should have record of these four fields of video: name, views, duration, time, thumbnail image URL
3. Once you have done the above two tasks, write a general program which should take the input of a youtube channel link, which then outputs a record of all the videos uploaded by that channel.

#### Project #2
Youtube Channel's Videos Comments Data Scraper [2023-03-12]
1. Write a Python program which should visit a youtube video, and scrape its comments. You should store all the comments in a CSV file. For example, if you visit this video of my mentor and employer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zghBofrKv7s, scrape all the comments of this video and store in a CSV file. The CSV file should have these columns: user name, user's thumbnail URL (profile image basically), commented at time, comment text and number of likes. The name of CSV file should be the video's name.
2. Write a Python program which takes input a youtube channel link, and create a CSV file in a folder, named against the youtube username, for each and every video on that channel. For example, if you give it the input of https://www.youtube.com/@ehmadzubair, it should create a folder named ehmadzubair which should have 67 separate CSV files in it (because the channel has 67 videos as of now).
3. [coming soon]
